# Community Toolbox

Welcome to **Community Toolbox**, a Hacktoberfest-friendly collection of small but
useful applications built by contributors from around the world. The repository
starts with a few handy command-line tools—like unit converters, BMI
calculators, and password generators—and is designed to make it easy for
beginners to add their own creations.

## Goals

- Provide approachable projects for people making their first open-source
  contributions during Hacktoberfest (and beyond).
- Encourage meaningful improvements to existing tools as well as the creation
  of new ones.
- Showcase practical examples of different programming languages and testing
  setups.

## Getting Started

Explore the `apps/` directory to see existing tools. Each application includes
simple documentation and automated tests to help you understand how everything
works.

If you would like to contribute, please read the
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for step-by-step instructions. The
repository is tagged with the `hacktoberfest` topic so your merged pull request
will count toward the event.
