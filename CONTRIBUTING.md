# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Community Toolbox! We welcome
improvements to existing tools as well as brand-new applications. If this is
one of your first pull requests, you're in the right place.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally and create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-tool
   ```
3. **Add your app** inside the `apps/` directory. Use a descriptive folder name
   (e.g., `apps/weather-cli`). Include automated tests so contributors and CI
   can verify that your app works as expected.
4. **Run the tests** for your app (and any others you touched) locally to make
   sure everything passes.
5. **Commit and push** your changes to your branch.
6. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this
   repository. Describe what you added or changed and include any relevant test
   instructions.

## Tips

- Keep your pull requests focused. Small, well-documented changes are easier to
  review.
- Update documentation if needed, such as README files within your app
  directory.
- Be respectful and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We look forward to seeing what you build!
